<p>We are creating a web application, with easy to digest graphs, to provide the largest amount of
accessibility to our audience. Our proposed solution to the climate change obstacle is a website which will allow
people to not only perceive but interact with the data in a manner that suits them. By creating a
solution that maps the data visually, while also allowing for the user to decompose the data in their
own style.</p>
