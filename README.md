# TSE-Group-2
## Short Description
Climate Change is one of the greatest dilemmas humanity has ever encountered, yet
its symptoms and consequences are still not fully grasped to this day. The swathes of
information in its current state are not always accessible, or not always comprehendible to
people who are not researchers in the area. This has led to large amounts of polarity in its
accepted existence and magnitude among the general populous. Resultantly, there is a
growing stagnation in how we as a civilization are acting to counteract it.

This issue is understood by specialists and publications, and there is work being done to
improve the public�s understanding of the dilemma through news briefings and data
visualisations, however these are not always tailored to a general audience.

Our proposed solution to this obstacle is to allow people to not only perceive but
interact with the data in a manner that suits them. By creating a solution that maps the data
visually, while also allowing for the user to decompose the data in their own style, we can
make the materials digestible.

Therefore, we�re creating a web application, with easy to digest graphs, to provide
the largest amount of accessibility to our audience. Our solution will utilise Python and the Flask Microframework for our backend. Python
is a language our team is well versed with, with the bonus of having an extensive library
ecosystem for data. We will employ a mix of HTML, JavaScript and a CSS Framework to build
the frontend UI, and interactive map. This will all be tied together by helper languages and
libraries like SQL and P5js to operate our map.
